The attached code is for the Getting and Cleaning Data project. The code in the file will follow below steps as required in the project description. 

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
step 1: download data
step 2: unzip data
step 3: load data
step 4: merge train and test data

2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
step 1: load feature name
step 2: extract mean and standard deviation of each measurements

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
step 1: load activity data
step 2: replace 1 to 6 with activity names

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
